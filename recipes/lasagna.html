  <h3>An easy lasagna recipe that saves me lots of time </h3>
<p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cheese Filling</li></ol>
<ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Meat Sauce</li></ol>
    <ul>  
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Lasagna</li></ol>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ul>
    <li><em>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</em></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
    <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><em>Assemble</em></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><em>Bake</em></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. If desired, broil at 450° to brown the top more, watch it carefully during this time.</li>
    <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
</ol>
