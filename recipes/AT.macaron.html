 <h3>This is an in-depth beginner’s guide to homemade French macarons. </h3>

<p>Like many home bakers, I was a French macaron beginner a few years ago. I started baking them after tasting the Lviv famous Cheese bakery macarons– talk about perfection! My homemade macarons weren’t nearly as flawless as the professional ones, but they worked for me at the time! However, the results weren’t always consistent. With 3 additional years of practice, I found a few small but very helpful improvements. Today’s recipe includes those updates </p>
<h2>Macaroons Are Not Macarons</h2>
<p>Macarons and macaroons are two completely different cookies. Macaroons have an extra O in the name and are coconut cookies. Macarons are delicate sandwich cookies. See the difference?</p>

<h3>What Do These French Macarons Taste Like?</h3>
<p>French macarons are delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior. Each individual cookie is known as a macaron shell. The shells are made without any chemical leaveners and get all of their lift from properly beaten egg whites. If you follow the recipe carefully, the cookies have a unique nougat-like, chewy texture. They should not be hollow. You can flavor macarons many ways, but this recipe is for plain macarons. They taste like sweet almond– and they’re delicious! You can always have fun with different flavorful fillings such as vanilla buttercream, lemon buttercream, salted caramel, or chocolate ganache.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing to know before baking French macarons at home, it’s this: these cookies require precision, patience, and practice. I’m going to do my best to prepare any French macaron beginner. You can do this!</p>
<h2>I am so happy now!</h2>

<h3>Are you ready to bake the best macarons in your life?</h3>
<p><em>Let's start a fun!</em></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ol>  
        <strong><li>WHITES:</li></strong>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>The bulk of French macaron batter is meringue made from properly beaten egg whites. For best and most consistent results, I strongly recommend using fresh egg whites instead of liquid egg whites from a carton. It’s imperative that NO egg yolks make it into the recipe. Like I taught you in our Swiss meringue buttercream recipe, any fat (yolk) in the egg whites will prevent them from reaching stiff peaks, a crucial step for the successful outcome in any French macaron recipe.</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>CREAM OF TARTAR:</li></strong>
        </ol>
        <ul> 
            <li>My old recipe doesn’t include this ingredient, but I started adding it after I began making successful batches of marshmallow meringue frosting and chocolate swirled meringue cookies. It just provides a little extra insurance. Let me explain– the acidity in cream of tartar helps the egg whites hold onto air and, like the sugar (explained next), helps prevent the egg whites from collapsing. If you’re making snickerdoodles or angel food cake, you already have this ingredient on hand. It’s sold with the spices.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>SUPERFINE SUGAR: </li></strong>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>In 3 additions, beat superfine sugar into the egg whites + cream of tartar. Without sugar, the protein molecules in egg whites will collapse. What is superfine sugar? Well, it’s regular granulated sugar that’s ground much finer, but not quite as fine as confectioners’ sugar. It’s also known as caster sugar. Superfine sugar’s granules are the best size to provide optimal structure for French macarons. Granulated sugar is simply too coarse, while confectioners’ sugar dissolves too quickly in the egg whites.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>FINE ALMOND FLOUR:</li> </strong>
        </ol>
<ul>
    <li>Almond flour is the ONLY flour that works in this French macaron recipe, however if you have an almond allergy– you could try these nut free macarons by Stella Parks. (I have not personally tried them.) Make sure you use almond flour, not almond meal. Almond flour is much finer and made from blanched, skinless almonds. Almond meal is coarser and contains almond skin.</li>

</ul>
<ol>
    <strong><li>CONFECTIONERS’ SUGAR: </li></strong>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li> Confectioners’ sugar adds bulk and sweetness to macaron batter. In this new recipe, I use equal parts confectioners’ sugar and almond flour to produce sturdy, more reliably successful macarons.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <strong><li>GEL FOOD COLORING (optional):</li></strong>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>inting macaron batter is completely optional. If you don’t tint it, the macarons will be a natural beige color. (And you can have fun with a colorful filling.) Avoid using liquid food coloring because it will change the consistency of your macaron batter. Instead, use 1-2 drops of gel food coloring.</li>
</ul>
